## The assignment

Download this repo and run this project locally. Validate the local HTML with the [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) (you can use the **Validate by Direct Input** option to copy and paste your HTML into this area). Fix all issues in the index.html. 

Tip: do this step by step and re-validate the code again; sometimes multiple errors disappear when fixing 1 line.
The only purpose of this assignment is to have no warnings or errors, so do some research (google) if you can't fix things immediately. 

Make sure that this edited website has no errors or warnings anymore. 

## Submitting your work
* Create a new branch called **gh-pages** and upload your local work into this branch.
* Start a new **pull request**, select **one** reviewer and make sure to put the (working) **GitHub Pages URL** in the comment section. 
* Do **not** merge this Pull Request yourself. That's up to the reviewer to decide (merging is approving the assignment).
